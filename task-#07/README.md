# Rich Scraper
I read about Web Scraping and tried to understand what web scraping is all about.
Then I saw some tutorials on how Golang can be used to perform web scraping.
On surfing through net gathering information about how to code in Golang using
colly from the web scraping point of view, I got an idea about the format to be followed 
to scrape data from a table type website. My code does not have any error but still
I'm unable to feed the desired data into the .csv file. I went through all existing 
websites, blogs, Stackoverflow, dev.md, reddit etc., in the internet but I failed 
in finding a fix only for this problem. As the amount of resources avaiable for
GoLang using colly framework under web scraping domain is low comapred to Python
using Beautiful soup etc.., and also due to lack of materials for understanding 
the scarping of data from websites using tag for websites of Forbes type and also
considering the time constriant, I could'nt come up with a 100% correct solution 
but still I've pushed the possible ways I had tried to do webscraping using
GoLang with Colly framework for your reference.
