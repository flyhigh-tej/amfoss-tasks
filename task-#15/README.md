# Project Euler
Questions of easy level were solved with ease as comapred to that of
the medium level ones. At any point if I get struck not knowing the
suitable code to be used even though I know the algorithm I search
Google for codes with expected functionality and use it. Under
acute situations of not able to frame the algorithm for a 
particular segment of the functionality I look for problem 
solutions and correct it from the point where I've gone wrong.
