# CS50
It was a must-watch tutorials for beginners who are into coding. Every 
lecture was very informative and I was able to get answers to many of 
the questions which were running through my mind about servers, creating
new filters, bits and bytes, memory storage in RAM, hexadecimal codes,
dynamic memory allocation,etc., I started doing the task once the lec
-ture was complete. The walkthrough by Brain gave me an idea about the
structure of the program to be framed. I started coding based on my
understanding about the the structure. I would look into Google for 
explanation videos at places where I get struck and comapare it with
Brian's explanation to understand it and then complete the code. But
majority of these required only walthrough while pset 4 especially
at places where I used to get struck, I refer some videos side by 
side walkthrough to get a clear picture about the actual process to 
be implemented using C Language. Thanks to the task-designers for
including such informative lectures as that of CS-50 for our tasks.
