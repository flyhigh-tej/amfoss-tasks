# TouchMeNot_. Game
I developed it using the Scratch platform. After attending CS50 Week 0 Course.
I got fascinated about creating something using Scratch. I decided to make a 
very very simple game. But on working with it my interest towards building 
that game started increasing manifold. I worked on it for a half a day, dint
even attend my classes properly, dint have my lunch, just sitting in front of 
the laptop screen from morning 7 till evening 4.30 as I was so much into it. Finally I made
it and Ive shared the file and its screenshot in this folder for your refernce.
You can run that file only on a scratch platform.. Thats the drawback else I could
have shared the actual game. I uploaded it here just because I want to show you 
my interest towards such coding appliactions and maybe this game might be simple
but it's just to show you my determination and passion to build innovative 
software technologies.
