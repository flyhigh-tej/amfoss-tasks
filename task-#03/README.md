# Programming
I did it with all my efforts based on the knowledge I've gained from my PSAT(Problem Solving & Algorithmic Thinking)
course till date and that's the reason this task was submitted by today afternoon. I faced many difficulties in this 
task and have some mistakes in it for which I could not come with accurate solutions even after surfing through the
net several times. I think its because of my lack of experience with Python, I could have used Java but its been 
more than 3 years, I've coded something with Java in either cases I will have to either learn the language and understand
the functioning of various features available in a much broader sense or refer my previous materials, refernce books
and watch some minor tutorials but due to the deadline set to complete all the tasks within the specified time and as 
it was mentioned in the tasks list to not get sidetracked into learning a new language, I had to cope up with existing
knowledge. I understood the logic behind almost 9 problems but due to lack of knowlege about various shortcut tools 
the language provides I was unable to implement my understanding into codes. Due to my interest in learning Python, I
had registered for a 300-hr course in Python at the beginning of this semester, but as the tasks had come up, I could
not attend them, Maybe if these tasks were assigned after that I would have tried attempting all the questions. Anyways
I was able to learn a few new accessibilities of Python while coding, A Thanks to the Task-designers for that..
