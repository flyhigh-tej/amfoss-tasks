I saw some tutorials wich gave an insight about working with API's in Python and went through 
the assigned material for understanding the basics about argpase library and its implementations
in command line interface. I saw some tutorials for getting a greater insight into how argpase 
functions can be used to generate a CLI. It was a really exciting task as I have never known
much about CLI applications and API usage in programs before.
