# Let me C
As I had some basic knowledge about C-programming and also as comments were
mentioned at places where changes needed to be made, this task was pretty
easier to move through. After initial stage of corrections the program was
run on a C compiler to clear the remaining errors. Some errors were resolved,
reffering StackOverflow and finally the entire code was debugged in accordance 
with comments mentioned in every section.
