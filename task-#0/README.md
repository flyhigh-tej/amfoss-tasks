# Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]
I had downloaded it before for bi0s club recruitment process so I shall recall some of tedious steps in that process. It was a bit difficult task indeed..
I got the link to download Ubuntu from bi0s wiki titled"Installing wsl2" which i shall specify at the end. The first difficulty that stood before me like
a mountain was enabling Hyper-V. I was using a Windows 10 Home version laptop which met the specified requirements and so my laptop by default was to have
Hyper-V but in the options nowhere it was visible. Then I cheked it on google where it showed that Hyper-V will be available on Windows 10 pro version only.
There was an another step mentioned below this step which was actually to be activated first before enabling Hyper-V in my case but after muliple seachings
in google and opening and closing the same enabling window, i was totally fed-up. After some time I again cheked the steps once again to discover the saga..
Alas! actually I should have seen the option of enabling the virtual machine before searching for Hyper-V. Then I enabled Virtual Machine and again went 
for Hyper-V.. Finally I lost the conquest in finding Hyper-V and skipped the Hyper-V step. The final step to install wsl-2 gave me an error for which the 
solution was not mentioned then i pinged a senior who was a part of the recruitment team. After long conversation he told me it might be because of my windows 
being an outdated version soon i chevk my version of windows which was not yet updated. Then somehow I managed to update and complete the final step and installed 
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS from microsoft store and followed the last procedure given in the blog to launch Ubuntu 20.04 LTS..
