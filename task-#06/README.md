# Flutter based UI task
This task took the highest amount of time for its completion while 
compared to its contemporaries. Flutter and dart language being
completely new, I spent a considerable amount of time watching
tutorials how to design an app using flutter. To bring the app
to its current apperance and interface I had to refer immense 
blogs, websites and cleared errors with the help of Google 
Search. The most most memorable incident with this task is 
while downloading android Studio and its configuration files.
The app was very slow in terms of response to changes and was
very slow in opening when clicked and also while running the 
app. I encountered an error several times while running the app
on my phone which gave a message "Gradle task assembleDebug 
failed with exit code 1" on my laptop screen. I tried many
fixes for this issue and somehow made the app install on my 
phone but the issue is it doesnt load the images on my screen
even though I ve followed the correct sytax and declartion with
no errors. I tried some fixes even for this issue but it dint work
then I came across an article which stated to reinstall the app and 
config files once again but due to lack of time and fear of loosing
fully complete code, I dint reinstall it and I think that's the only 
reason possible for my images being invisible in the app screen-
recording video.A special note of thanks to Akshat Tripathi Bhaiya
and my galaxy mentors Jithin John chettan and Akshay Nair chettan
without whose timely help I could not have completed this within the
deadline and clear some errors for which proper fixes were not 
available in the net.
