# INTROSPECTION 
### Why must we choose you?
Passion is something which comes from the heart and it drives us to do more of that irrespective of our fatigue or circumstances, it automatically
becomes important than everything else to us at that moment and the happiness being attained on its successful completion is probably one of the 
best feelings a person can ever have. I want to achieve that ultimate happiness in my area of interest which is competitve coding, open-source 
coding, etc., I am hardworking and dedicated when it comes to programming about which Iam very passionate. Days while doing the tasks were never 
easy, it took days of hardwork and efforts. I had failed miserably in various stages while doing these tasks for instance I lost the 3/4th of the 
uploaded tasks into github due some error while pushing the file just before two days left for the last date, including others retaliations too, 
but beyond all these hardships the magic that drove me was my deep passion to get into the club and to learn and work with people like you.
Taking my technical backgrond under consideration I have learnt C++ and Java during my Class 9, 10(ICSE) in which I scored 98/100 for my board
exams in my computer applications paper which was the highest mark in the school for that subject that particular year. During my vacations I
had completed an advanced diploma course in Java programming and passed the course with distinction. I'm good at creative, logical and 
intellectual thinking capabilities. Iam an ardent to be coder looking for a very supportive environment like foss club where my coding skills
can be nutured and can achieve my goal to represent the college in various national and international contests and bring back laurels and pride
to the club, college and country and I'm really serious about it . The amFOSS has been my biggest fantasy ever right from the time I've heard
about this club from amFOSS alumni and pass-out seniors from this college. I'm sincere,hardworking and a determined champ with big dreams. I 
look forward to work with like minded peers seniors and juniors like me with whom I shall work to the best of my abilities and prove your 
decision for haven choose me, right without a bit of regret ever. I assure you that I will always be an asset for this prestigious club. I'm 
very friendly and easily accessible to all those who approach me. I beleive in teamwork as it can do wonders.

well, make good friendships with everyone in college, Participate in GSoc 2021, learn to solve a 3*3 rubix cube fully, To get adapted to solve

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I will help my peers and mentor my fellow juniors in best possible ways I can by guiding and supporting them at any course of time I mean even after 
my completion of 4 years study at Amrita. Bring in name and fame to the club by participating and winning in various contests, hackathons etc., at 
national and international levels. Create a good outreach for this club by proving my aquired talents on working with amFOSS.
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The selection consists of tasks and interview which makes the entry into foss club as a member very special and also we are previleged have a prior 
experience that too at a very early stage of attending a real interview and selection rounds which is exclusively available to students of Amrita
Amritapuri in the 1st semester where other reputed colleges in the country would ever provide an oppurtunity. Its good in a sense because we can 
ensure that we are working with a like-minded enthusiastic group which improves our standards of knowledge and preserves the quality and standards
of the club as it is.
