# INTROSPECTION 
### Why must we choose you?
Passion is something which comes from the heart and it drives us to do more of that irrespective of our fatigue or circumstances, it automatically
becomes important than everything else to us at that moment and the happiness being attained on its successful completion is probably one of the 
best feelings a person can ever have. I want to achieve that ultimate happiness in my area of interest which is competitve coding, open-source 
coding, etc., I am hardworking and dedicated when it comes to programming about which Iam very passionate. Taking my technical backgrond under 
consideration I have learnt C++ and Java during my Class 9, 10(ICSE) in which I scored 98/100 for my board exams in my computer application paper 
which was the highest mark in the school for that subject that particular year. During my vacations I had completed an advanced diploma course in 
Java programming and passed the course with distinction. Iam an ardent to be coder looking for a very supportive environment like foss club where my 
coding skills can be nutured and can achieve my goal to represent not only college in various icpc's, hackathons,etc., but also represent India in 
international events and bring back laurels to our country, college and club. I'm sincere, hardworking and a determined champ with big dreams. I look
forward to work with like minded peers seniors and juniors like me for which I shall work to the best of my abilities and prove your decision for haven
choose me, right without a bit of regret. I assure you that I will always be an asset for this prestigious foss club.  
### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
Develop coding skills as much as possible, make innovative software technologies beneficial for a large section of the population, participate in various
hackathons, to balance foss club activities and academics equally well, make good friendships with everyone in college, Practice coding everyday atleast 
a little everyday, learn to solve a 3*3 rubix cube fully, enjoy college life balacing everything and start creating beautiful memories for a lifetime.
### How would you contribute back to the club?
I remember a famous quote of Sri.Ratan Tata "If you want to walk fast, walk alone but if you want to walk far, walk together...". I believe in this 
principle firmly and so I focus on a common development rather than an individual development. I will help my peers and fellow juniors in best possible
ways I can by guiding and supporting them at any course of time I mean even after my completion of 4 years study at Amrita. I joined Amrita Amritapuri
mainly because it had amfoss and bi0s and myself being a person outside Kerala came to know of this club its because of the good outreach of this club 
by its mentors and members..The same way by achieving great success in various coding contests I shall bring name and fame to this super cool foss club
thereby increasing its outreach.
### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Selection process is really good mainly because we have assistance provided at every step at all times also the selection consists of tasks and 
interview which makes the entry into foss club as a member very special and also we are previleged have a prior experience that too at a very early stage of attending
a real interview and selection rounds which is exclusively available to students of Amrita Amritapuri in the 1st semester where other reputed colleges 
in the country would ever provide an oppurtunity.
