# Circuit Design
I had browsed in net to know about how a rangefinder
is connected to a circuit in an automated parking system.
I have worked with all other elements such as audrino 
board and breadboard etc., during various lab sessions.
The code for functioning of the rangefinder was modified
as per the needs to make an automated parking system.
