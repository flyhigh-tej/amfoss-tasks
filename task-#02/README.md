# Begin your journey with Linux and Git
It was a very exciting task to work on.. After trails of getting low even after immense efforts put in to solve the task-3 problems for 
quite a long period of time, this task lit up my hopes by being able to understand the tutorial very well in example for each command.
I managed to prepare short notes of what i learnt from the tutorial and understood it well by trying it on the terminal window by myself.
After the completion it gave me a confidence to write basic commands on my own in Linux. Then I took up the task and completed it with much
ease except for the part to clone my github repository and push my file to the main branch which over practising eventually became easier for
me. Thanks to the task designers for giving me an oppurtunity to gather these valuable knowledge about Linux and its features without which I
would have been an utter 0 in these.
