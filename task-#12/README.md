# Make the Block
I saw the video attached along with task description.
I watched it multiple times to get a clear understanding
about how a block chain transaction actually works. I
came to know more about blockchain through various 
websites in Google especially on topics like hashcode,
private key etc., I saw some tutorials to understand how
a block is made, a transaction is coded and how multiple
blocks are chained. I saw a tutorial in which a block-
chain transaction was well explained. I saw that tutorial
twice and started to code by myself by just looking in at
places where I get struck. I used Java for coding the
blockchain transaction as I have prior experience on
working with it but not having a strong grip right now
but,I still remember the basic stuff about the language
Therefore, I proceeded with it.
